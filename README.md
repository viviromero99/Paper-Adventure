# Paper Adventure
Infinite run game project made by Leonardo Nanci and Viviane Romero for an university assignment.
You start as a drawn stickman in an uni student's notebook paper that has to avoid encountering with erasers and try to pick as many
pencils you can while playing. You can collect special items that will give you superpowers.
If you lose pencils to the point that the counter of pencils hits < 0 then you die. You can die by falling off of the platforms too.
Good game!
